# eloquent-chapter6-7

I read through both chapters. I'm starting to understand chapter 6 with objects and prototypes. 
However, once I got to chapter 7 it got really confusing to me. I feel like when I'm looking at the code I 
can understand and see what is being implimented but I for sure can't create it by myself if I had to. I'm going to try
to go through it again in smaller sections and see if I can create the animation.
